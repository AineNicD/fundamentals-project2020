# fundamentals-project2020
My GMIT Fundamentals of Data Analysis project

This repository contains a project in a jupyter notebook given in the Fundementals of Data Analysis module in Gmit HDip data analytics. 
### project2020: [project2020.ipynb](https://github.com/AineNicD/fundamentals-project2020/blob/main/project2020.ipynb)

### [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
-is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It is best installed with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). 
Anaconda simplifies package management and deployment by having the most popular python packages installed on your machine even before you know you will be using them. 
Jupyter can also be installed separately from its website.

### Launching Jupyter Notebook App
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu or by typing 'Jupyter Notebook' in a terminal.
### How do run/save this jupyter notebook
- First click on Raw.
- Then, press ctrl+s to save it as project2020.ipynb (files from GitHub are saved as text files as default, so you'll have to manually type '. ipynb' after the file name to make this work.)
- Open CMDER and type in Jupyter Notebook
- Jupyter notebook should appear in your browser 
- Go to the file location where you saved the project2020.ipynb
- Open file.

# Project instructions
~~~
"Instructions
In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python
on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the
following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.
To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to
other types of regression on this data set. Rest assured, all the above concepts will be
explored in lecture videos and other materials in the coming semester."
